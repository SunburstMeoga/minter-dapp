      "The Minter project is a marketing program developed on the basis of the HashAhead public chain as the underlying development of the marketing project. At the early stage of a public chain project launch, attracting users and building up an active user group is crucial to the success of the project. Therefore, the user attraction project is carried out with the aim of rapidly expanding the project's popularity, attracting more users to participate, and laying a solid foundation for the long-term development of the project.",
